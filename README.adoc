# Proxynator

Collecting application metrics in google trace by setting up a http proxy.
This project has been set up for use in kubernetes, where application metrics
are not readily available. The metrics are collected in a non-intrusive
manner.

What it gives you, is a list in google trace of your calls, with timing metrics. The
metrics logged as the host+URI, which makes it possible to follow the performance of
the calls.

## Future directions

At the time of writing, this project is a bare bones proof-of-concept, and no
effort has been put into optimizing the data collection and processing.

Future improvements would be:

* Use buffering for metrics collection. Currently just scaling up number of instances.
* Implement sub-trace support. Currently only supporting 1 level. Sub level
  tracing would need client library / code for the different platforms.
* Release to docker hub

## Usage

You need to adapt these instructions to what suits your environment.

Build the code, and the docker image:

```
mvn -Prutebanken
```

This gives you the image `eu.gcr.io/carbon-1287/proxynator:0.0.1-SNAPSHOT`.
Tag it as you wish, and push it to your favorite docker repository. The
maven project is based on the fabric8.io maven plugin.

There are 2 more steps:

* Start the service and pod
* Add instruction to use the proxy from your other pods

### Starting the service and pod

The following configuration can be adapted to your environment:

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: proxynator
  labels:
    name: proxynator
spec:
  ports:
  - port: 8080
    targetPort: 8080
    name: http
  - port: 9077
    targetPort: 9077
    name: proxyport
  selector:
    name: proxynator
---
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: proxynator
  labels:
    name: proxynator
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      name: proxynator
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        name: proxynator
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: proxynator
        image: eu.gcr.io/carbon-1287/proxynator:0.0.1-SNAPSHOT
        imagePullPolicy: Always
        ports:
          - containerPort: 8080
            name: http
          - containerPort: 9077
            name: proxyport
        resources:
          requests:
            memory: "250Mi"
            cpu: "100m"
          limits:
            memory: "500Mi"
            cpu: "200m"
        command:
          - /deployments/run-java.sh
        env:
          - name: JAVA_OPTIONS
            value: "-server -Dspring.config.location=http://SOMEWHERE/proxynator.properties -Xmx250m -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8"
        volumeMounts:
          - name: trace-key
            mountPath: /etc/secret/trace-key
        readinessProbe:
          httpGet:
            path: '/proxynator/health/ready'
            port: 8080
          initialDelaySeconds: 10
          timeoutSeconds: 5
        livenessProbe:
          httpGet:
            path: '/proxynator/health/up'
            port: 8080
          initialDelaySeconds: 45
          timeoutSeconds: 15
      imagePullSecrets:
        - name: rutebanken-registry-key
      volumes:
      - name: trace-key
        secret:
          secretName: carbon-default-application-key
```

#### Kubernetes configuration

You need to have modified the `application.properties` file, or supply some
external properties. Interesting properties are:

```
server.port=8080
proxy.port:9077
google.credentials.location=/etc/secret/trace-key/google-application-key.json
```

You need to have added a secret similarly to this:

```
kubectl create secret generic carbon-default-application-key --from-file=google-application-key.json=Project-d2d722ccd9e1-key.json
```

### Using the proxy

Add the following to your java application:

```
-Dhttp.proxyHost=proxynator -Dhttp.proxyPort=9077 -Dhttp.nonProxyHosts=
```

The setup for other platforms are analogous.
